# Backtest-On-Holdings

Utilizing the top 4 performing objective functions from the backtest on S&P 400 companies further backtesting was conducted on the historical holdings of the Saluki Student Investment fund. With quadratic programming the 4 objective functions were maximized or minimized. Rebalance dates, sector weights, and box constraints were kept inline with the historical reality.
In order to analyze performance 20,000 different ways assets could have been allocated within the portfolio each period were generated. With the 20,000 individual times series a probability distribution was created for Information Ratio, 5 Factor Alpha, and Jensenâ€™s Alpha. Many of the files I used are missing. At the time I was working on this project I had not thought to put this project on Github.
